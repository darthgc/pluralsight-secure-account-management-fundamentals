Why we need this course?
	There is more and bigger security risks

-------------------------------
Fundamental Security Concepts
-------------------------------

The 3 objectives of HTTPS
	Authenticity
		Confident that you are on the right website (valid certificate (CA))
	Integrity
		Confidence that the information that we send and received has not been manipulated (by a MiTM)
	Confidentiality
		Confidence that nobody has been able to read sent/received data

	The first 2 often gets neglected (ex: login form is not loaded over https)

Brute force attacks
	How frequently do the website allow login attempt?

Account enumeration attacks
	Dev. do not consider this often

	The website disclose if the account exists or not

	This is a privacy risk (do someone use a specific bank? Could be usefull for fishing)

Understanding CSRF
	attacker sends a malicious link (fishing scam, email, social media, invalidated redirect) -> user click -> go to the hacker's website -> the hacker's website send a constructed request to the target website to perform some action on it (usually, the user must be logged to the target website)

	Ex: change psw

Event logging
	Important to reconstruct what went wrong and where to take action

	What to log?
		Who performed the action
		What action was performed? On what resource? (url, function name, ...)
		When the action was performed? (gives also chronolgy)
		From where? (IP address (yes they can obfuscate it: VPN, tor, ...))
		With what? (browser, user agent, ... (can be obfuscated))
		Via where? (what path did the person take to get to the path, usefull for CSRF (was there an attaker site involved?))

Summary
	HTTPS everything
	Brute force comes in many shapes
	Log everything, as long as you can!
